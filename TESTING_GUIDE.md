## 🎯 Testing Strategy by Layer

### 1. 🔧 Unit Testing (Target: 80% coverage)

#### **Critical Business Logic to Test:**

**Authentication Service (`auth.service.ts`)**:
```typescript
describe('AuthService', () => {
  // Email verification flow
  // XSS sanitization in organization creation
  // Owner vs Employee onboarding logic
  // Approval workflow
  // BIN validation for employees
});
```

**Customer Aggregate (`customer.aggregate.ts`)**:
```typescript
describe('Customer Aggregate', () => {
  // Status transition rules
  // Lead score validation (0-100)
  // Value calculations
  // Tag management
  // Follow-up scheduling
});
```

**Value Objects**:
```typescript
describe('CustomerInfo', () => {
  // Email validation
  // Phone number formatting
  // Name validation rules
});

describe('CustomerStatus', () => {
  // Valid status transitions
  // Business rule enforcement
});
```

### 2. 🔗 Integration Testing

#### **Full Workflow Testing:**

**Authentication Integration**:
```bash
# Owner Registration → Email Verification → Onboarding → Organization Creation
# Employee Registration → Onboarding → Approval → Organization Access
# Security: XSS protection, Rate limiting, BIN validation
```

**Customer Management Integration**:
```bash
# Customer Creation → Validation → Database Persistence → Listing
# Search and Pagination → Filtering → Data Isolation
# Business Rules: Organization access control
```

**AI Assistant Integration**:
```bash
# Configuration → Personality Setup → Chat Functionality
# Mock Response Generation → User Personalization
```

### 3. 🌐 End-to-End Testing

#### **Complete User Journeys:**

1. **Owner Journey**:
   - Register → Verify Email → Complete Onboarding → Create Organization
   - Configure AI Assistant → Create Customers → Manage Sales Pipeline
   - Approve Employees → Verify Organization Access

2. **Employee Journey**:
   - Register → Join Organization → Await Approval → Gain Access
   - Access Customer Data → Use AI Assistant → Work with Pipelines

3. **Security Journey**:
   - Attempt XSS attacks → Verify sanitization
   - Test rate limiting → Verify protection
   - Invalid authentication → Verify blocking
